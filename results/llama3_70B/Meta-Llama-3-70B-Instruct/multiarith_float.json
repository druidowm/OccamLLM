To find the total amount of money Katie earned, we multiply the number of necklaces she sold by the price of each necklace:\n\n30 necklaces \u00d7 $16.91 per necklace =?\n\nTo multiply these numbers, we can use a calculator or do the calculation by hand:\n\n30 \u00d7 16.91 = 506.30\n\nSo, Katie earned a total of $506.30.<|eot_id|>", "correct_answer": 507.3, "is_correct": 0, "rel_error": 0.001971220185294697, "metadata": null}, {"system": "Solve step by step.", "input": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nSolve step by step.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nA trivia team had 18 members total, but during a game 7 members didn't show up.
