Since Lucy bought 14 packs of groceries, the total cost is the sum of the cost of each pack:\n\nTotal cost = Cost of 2 cookie packs + Cost of 12 cake packs\n\nWe don't know the cost of each pack, but we can represent it as y. So, the equation becomes:\n\nTotal cost = 2y + 12y\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nTotal cost = 14y\n\n6. Substitute the equation for Total cost into the previous equation:\n\nx - 56 = 14y\n\n7. Now we have a linear equation with one variable, x. We can solve for x:\n\nx = 14y + 56\n\nSince we don't know the value of y (the cost of each pack), we can't find the exact value of x (the initial amount).

Since the cost is unknown, we can represent it as c. So, the total amount of money made is:\n\nc + 10x = 60\n\nWe want to find the number of t-shirts sold (x), so we can solve for x.\n\nFirst, we can subtract c from both sides of the equation to get:\n\n10x = 60 - c\n\nNext, we can divide both sides by 10 to get:\n\nx = (60 - c) / 10\n\nNow, we need to find the value of c (cost).

This means that the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is at least 18 people.\n\nWe can set up an inequality to represent this:\n\n9x \u2265 18\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 9:\n\nx \u2265 18/9\n\nx \u2265 2\n\nSince x is the number of seats, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the minimum number of seats on the Ferris wheel is 2.\n\nHowever, the problem asks how many seats the Ferris wheel has, not the minimum number of seats. Since 18 people can ride the wheel at the same time, it means that the Ferris wheel has at least 2 seats. If it had only 2 seats, it could only hold 18 people, but it can actually hold more than that.\n\nTo find the actual number of seats, we can divide 18 by 9:\n\n18 \u00f7 9 = 2\n\nThis means that the Ferris wheel has at least 2 seats. To find the next whole number, we can add 1 to 2:\n\n2 + 1 = 3\n\nSince each seat can hold 9 people, the Ferris wheel can hold:\n\n3 seats \u00d7 9 people/seat = 27 people\n\nHowever, the problem states that 18 people can ride the wheel at the same time, which means that the Ferris wheel can actually hold more than 27 people. To find the next whole number, we can add 1 to 3:\n\n3 + 1 = 4\n\nThe Ferris wheel can hold:\n\n4 seats \u00d7 9 people/seat = 36 people\n\nSince 18 people can ride the wheel at the same time, the Ferris wheel actually has 4 seats.<|eot_id|>", "correct_answer": 2.0, "is_correct": 1, "rel_error": 0.0}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nSolve step by step.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDanny collects bottle caps and wrappers.
