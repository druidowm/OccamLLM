Now, we are told that Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug. This means that:\n\nEd's new number of marbles = Doug's original number of marbles + x + 8\n\n6. Now we can substitute the value of x from step 4 into the equation from step 5:\n\nEd's new number of marbles = Doug's original number of marbles + x + 8\n\n7. Now we can solve for x by subtracting Doug's original number of marbles from both sides of the equation:\n\nx + 8 = Ed's new number of marbles - Doug's original number of marbles\n\n8.
