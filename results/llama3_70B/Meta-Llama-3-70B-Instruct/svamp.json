If Jake has 7 peaches and 18 more than Jill, that means Jill has 7 - 18 peaches. But that's a negative number! So, let's try subtracting 7 from both sides instead:\n7 - Jill's peaches = 18\n\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n-Jill's peaches = 18 - 7\n-Jill's peaches = 11\n\nDivide both sides by -1:\nJill's peaches = -11/1\nJill's peaches = 11/1\nJill's peaches = 11\n\nSo, Jill has 11 peaches.

To find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days:\n\n810 pages \u00f7 664 days = approximately 1.22 pages/day\n\nSince we want to find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to convert this to chapters.

After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell has 415 cards left.\n\n3. Since Nell has 415 cards left, and she gave some away, the number of cards she gave away is:\n\n665 (initial cards) - 415 (cards left) = 250 cards given away\n\n4. We don't know how many baseball cards and Ace cards Nell gave away, but we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say Nell gave away x baseball cards and (250 - x) Ace cards.\n\n5. Now, we can set up an equation based on the number of cards Nell has left:\n\n(309 - x) + (356 - (250 - x)) = 415\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n309 - x + 356 - 250 + x = 415\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n415 - 250 = 415 - x\n\n165 = x\n\nSo Nell gave away 165 baseball cards.\n\n6. To find the number of Ace cards Nell gave away, subtract x from 250:\n\n250 - 165 = 85 Ace cards given away\n\n7.

Finally, to find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has, subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards:\n\n144 (baseball cards) - 271 (Ace cards) = -127\n\nSince we can't have a negative number of cards, this result means Nell has 127 more Ace cards than baseball cards.<|eot_id|>", "correct_answer": 266.0, "is_correct": 0, "rel_error": 0.018796992481203006, "metadata": null}, {"system": "Solve step by step.", "input": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nSolve step by step.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nIf Lewis earns a total of $ 460 during 5 weeks of harvest.

So, the total number of beads used is 32x.\n\nSince Emily used up all the beads, the total number of beads (2b) is equal to the total number of beads used (32x).\n\nWe can set up the equation: 2b = 32x\n\nNow, we want to find the value of x, which is the number of beads each necklace needs.\n\nTo do that, we can divide both sides of the equation by 32:\n\n2b / 32 = x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nb / 16 = x\n\nSince we don't know the value of b, we can't find the exact value of x. But we can say that x = b / 16.\n\nHowever, we can try to find a possible value of b that makes sense. Let's say each bag had 16 beads (which is a reasonable number). Then, b = 16.\n\nSubstituting b = 16 into the equation, we get:\n\nx = 16 / 16\nx = 1\n\nSo, each necklace needs 1 bead!<|eot_id|>", "correct_answer": 16.0, "is_correct": 1, "rel_error": 0.0, "metadata": null}, {"system": "Solve step by step.", "input": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nSolve step by step.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nJerry had 4 action figures on a shelf in his room.
