To find the number of problems on each page, we can divide the remaining problems (40) by the number of pages (5).\n\n40 \u00f7 5 = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 problems on each page.<|eot_id|>", "correct_answer": 8.0, "is_correct": 1, "rel_error": 0.0}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nSolve step by step.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nEmily bought 4 new chairs and 2 new tables for her house.

So, the total time it takes her to put together all the tables is:\n2 tables x 8 minutes/table = 16 minutes\n\n3. To find the total time it takes Emily to finish putting together all the furniture, we add the time it takes to put together the chairs and the tables:\n32 minutes (chairs) + 16 minutes (tables) = 48 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes Emily 48 minutes to finish putting together all the furniture.<|eot_id|>", "correct_answer": 48.0, "is_correct": 1, "rel_error": 0.0}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nSolve step by step.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nDave was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time.

Since he can't carry a fraction of a tray, he'll need to make another trip to pick up the remaining 8 trays.\n\nSo, Dave will make 2 trips for the first table.\n\n4. Now, let's move on to the second table. Dave needs to pick up 55 trays.\n5. Again, we'll divide the number of trays (55) by the number of trays he can carry (9):\n\n55 \u00f7 9 = 6 with a remainder of 1\n\nThis means Dave will need to make 6 trips to pick up 54 trays (6 x 9 = 54), and then he'll have 1 tray left over.
