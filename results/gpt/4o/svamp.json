How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?", "output": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Count Check:**\n   - Matthew had 13 crackers and 15 cakes, totaling 28 items (13 crackers + 15 cakes = 28 items).\n   - He has 28 friends. This suggests the total number of crackers and cakes might need to align with his friends' count, although he has more friends than crackers and cakes.\n\n2. **Distribution of Items:**\n   - Given that Matthew distributed these items equally to his 28 friends, each friend should ideally get an equal share.\n\n3. **Share Calculation:**\n   - Since each friend should get an equal number of crackers and cakes, let's denote the number of crackers each friend gets as \\(x\\) and the number of cakes each friend gets as \\(y\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(x + y\\) should equal the total amount each friend gets. This should be the same for all 28 friends.\n\n4. **Setting up the Equations:**\n   - Each friend received crackers and cakes such that:\n     \\[\n     28x = 13 \\quad (\\text{since } 28 \\text{ friends received crackers})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     28y = 15 \\quad (\\text{since } 28 \\text{ friends received cakes})\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solving:**\n   - Solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{13}{28}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{15}{28}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Simplification:**\n   - \\(x = \\frac{13}{28}\\) is the fraction of a cracker each friend gets.\n   - \\(y = \\frac{15}{28}\\) is the fraction of a cake each friend gets.\n\nHence, each person gets:\n- **Crackers:** \\( \\frac{13}{28} \\) crackers per person.\n- **Cakes:** \\( \\frac{15}{28} \\) cakes per person.\n\nThis means they get less than a whole cracker and a whole cake per person.", "correct_answer": 1.0, "is_correct": 1, "rel_error": 0.0}, {"input": "Baker sold 44 cakes.
