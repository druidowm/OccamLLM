First, we need to find out how many working video games Mike has. Since 9 of the 15 games weren't working, the number of working games is:\n\n15 - 9 = 6\n\nSo, Mike has 6 working video games.\n2. Next, we need to find out how much money Mike can earn by selling each working game for $5 each. To do this, we multiply the number of working games by the price of each game:\n\n6 games x $5 each = $30\n\nSo, Mike can earn a total of $30 by selling his working video games.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $30.</s>", "correct_answer": 30.0, "is_correct": 1, "rel_error": 0.0}, {"input": "<s> [INST] <<SYS>>\nSolve step by step.\n<</SYS>>\n\n Each chocolate bar in a box cost $6.
