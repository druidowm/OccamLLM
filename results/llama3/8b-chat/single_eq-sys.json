The bike rental shop charges 17 dollars plus 7 dollars an hour for renting a bike.\n2. Tom paid 80 dollars to rent a bike, which is the total amount he paid.\n3. To find the number of hours Tom paid for, we need to subtract the initial 17-dollar charge from the total amount he paid: 80 - 17 = 63 dollars.\n4. Since Tom paid 7 dollars an hour, we can divide the remaining amount (63 dollars) by 7 to find the number of hours: 63 \u00f7 7 = 9 hours.\n\nTherefore, Tom paid for the bike to be checked out for 9 hours.<|eot_id|>", "correct_answer": 9.0, "is_correct": 1, "rel_error": 0.0}, {"input": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nSolve step by step.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nOne evening, a restaurant served a total of 0.2 of a loaf of wheat bread and 0.4 of a loaf of white bread.

The restaurant served a total of 0.2 of a loaf of wheat bread. This means they served 2/10 of a loaf.\n2. The restaurant served a total of 0.4 of a loaf of white bread. This means they served 4/10 of a loaf.\n3. To find the total number of loaves served, we need to add the fractions. We can do this by finding a common denominator, which is 10.\n4. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 10:\n\t* 2/10 = 2/10 (no change)\n\t* 4/10 = 4/10 (no change)\n5. Now we can add the fractions:\n\t* 2/10 + 4/10 = 6/10\n6. To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\t* 6 \u00f7 2 = 3\n\t* 10 \u00f7 2 = 5\n7. So, the simplified fraction is 3/5. This means the total number of loaves served is 3/5 of a loaf.\n8. Since we can't serve a fraction of a loaf, we need to convert this to a whole number. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 5:\n\t* 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n\t* 5 \u00d7 5 = 25\n9. So, the total number of loaves served is 15/25.
