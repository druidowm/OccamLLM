How many more bottle caps did danny throw away than those he found at the park?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "output": "Danny started with some bottle caps. He found 30 at the park. So he had 30 + some bottle caps. Then he threw away 63. So he had 30 + some - 63. Now he has 42 bottle caps. So 30 + some - 63 = 42. We can solve this equation by adding 63 to both sides. 30 + some = 42 + 63. This gives us 30 + some = 105. Now we can subtract 30 from both sides. some = 105 - 30. some = 75. So Danny started with 75 bottle caps. He threw away 63. So he threw away 63 - 75 = 12 more bottle caps than he found at the park.
